Average height of the wheat was 3-4 inches. Total amount of fertilizer applied was 240 gals on 14.82 acres (6 hectares). One gallon of 28% fertilizer weighs 10.67 lbs. 48.38 lbs N/A (54.31 kg N/ha) was applied. Weather Conditions: Mostly sunny with air temperature 76 degrees F. Relative Humidity was 40%. Wind was out of the west-southwest at 0-8 mph's averaging 5 mph's. Time of application was between 1:45 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. Equipment Used: JD 5220 tractor traveling 5.0-6.0 mph?s (gear C1, 1600-1800 rpm's) with a pull type Top Air sprayer equipped with a hydraulic centrifugal sprayer pump and a Raven 440 automatic carrier control unit.

Applied 28% nitrogen solution (28-0-0) at 16 gals/acre (150L/ha) to all replications of treatment 3 on the LTER main site winter wheat, (reps 6, 1, 3, 2, 4, & 5). Average height of the wheat was 2-3 inches. Total amount of fertilizer applied was 239 gals on 14.82 acres (6 hectares). One gallon of 28% fertilizer weighs 10.67 lbs. 48.18 lbs N/A (54.09 kg N/ha) was applied. The goal was to apply the nitrogen fertilizer at 3/5 (0.60) rate of the total amount applied to treatments 1 and 2. The protocol was to apply a total amount of 80 lbs N/A for treatments 1 and 2. We applied 32 lbs N/A in the autumn of 2003 so we were trying to apply another 48 lbs N/A in the spring of 2004 on treatments 1 and 2. The 3/5 rate of nitrogen applied to treatment 3 was based on the total annual amount, spring and fall amounts, of nitrogen, not just 3/5 of the nitrogen applied in the spring. Therefore, treatment 3 needed to receive to same amount of nitrogen in the spring as treatments 1 and 2 received, 80 lbs N/A * 0.60 = 48 lbs N/A. Treatment 3 did not receive any nitrogen in 2003. Weather Conditions: Mostly sunny with air temperature ranging from 77-79 degrees F. Relative Humidity was ranging from 30-37%. Wind was out of the west-southwest at 0-8 mph's averaging 3 mph's. Time of application was between 4:00 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. Equipment Used: JD 5220 tractor traveling 5.0-6.0 mph (gear C1, 1600-1800 rpm's) with a pull type Top Air sprayer equipped with a hydraulic centrifugal sprayer pump and a Raven 440 automatic carrier control unit.

Applications were made using a John Deere 7420 B traveling at 1.6 mph (A4 1300 rpm) and a Gandy Orbit-Air fertilizer applicator controlled by a Raven 6000 which monitored the application and automatically adjusted the metering rate for changes in ground speed. For the Gandy/Raven set-up, the following were used: Density 64 lbs/cu ft; metering wheel 1 1/4"" diameter (yellow); deflector spacing 22""; meter cal number 206; air pressure 13 p.s.i. Boom length 30ft, nozzles 16-24 inches above the ground level. 

The first application across all replications was on Monday August 25, 2014 as well as the second application for reps (5, 3,). The second application for reps (4, 2, 1, 6) was completed on Tuesday August 26, 2014. Weather conditions on 8/25/14 at 8:10 a.m. 69 degrees F, 95 % humidity, winds calm out of the south east (end application 3:15 p.m.) Weather conditions on 8/26/14 at 9:30 a.m. were 74 degrees F, 86% humidity, winds 5 mph avg. out of the south. End application 2:20 p.m. 77 degrees F, 73% humidity, 8 mph avg out of the Northwest.

LTER Main Site treatment T6 only got partial application of potash and that was 270 lbs/A potash (0-0-60) on July 13, 2013. Due to time restraints we were unable to get the remaining 230 lbs/A of potash on the alfalfa. Protocol was to apply 288 lbs/A K2O, however the 270 lbs/A of potash (0-0-60) put on in July supplied 162 lbs/A K2O out of the 300 lbs/A K2O that the protocol called for. Also (NO boron was added in 2013). Protocol had Boron being applied at 2 lbs/A.",http://aglog.kbs.msu.edu/observations/2331

Actual amounts applied on the 15 acres (6 ha) were 3,920 lbs (1,782 kg) of 0-46-0, 5,990 lbs (2,723 kg) of 0-0-62, and 50 lbs (22.7 kg) of boron. The fertilizers were blended together and applied at the same time. The fertilizer was applied with a JD 7400 tractor, C3 1700 rpm, around 6-7 mph, and a Willmar 6 ton pull type spinner spreader. With a spinner spreader it would have been difficult to spread, in one pass, the entire amount of fertilizer recommended. The pattern of the fertilizer coming out of the spreader may not be a uniform pattern at such a high rate of fertilizer per acre therefore; I split the application rate in half then drove over the plots twice. The driving intervals were based on a 40 ft spreading pattern. The second time over the plots I drove between the first set of driving intervals. After spreading fertilizer on all six replications I had some fertilizer remaining in the spreader (about 1,992 lbs) so I applied the remaining fertilizer onto replications 1, 2, and 5, i.e. I did not change the setting on the fertilizer spreader and I went over reps 1, 2, and 5 for a third time. Replications 1, 2, and 5 had the lowest amount of P and K in the soil, i.e. the highest fertilizer recommendations was for reps 1, 2, and 5. Actual amounts applied to replications 1, 2, and 5 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 2,352 lbs (1,069 kg) of 0-46-0, 3,594 lbs (1,634 kg) of 0-0-62, and 30 lbs (13.64 kg) of boron. In replications 1, 2, and 5 the 314 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 144 lbs/A (161.7 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 479 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 297 lbs/A (333 kg/ha) of K2O. The 30 lbs of boron provided 4 lbs/A (4.5 kg/ha) of boron. Actual amounts applied to replications 3, 4, and 6 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 1,568 lbs (713 kg) of 0-46-0, 2,396 lbs (1,089 kg) of 0-0-62, and 20 lbs (9 kg) of boron. In replications 3, 4, and 6 the 209 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 96 lbs/A (107.8 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 319 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 198 lbs/A (222 kg/ha) of K2O.
