(PLS of 51.75 makes the new target 23.19 lbs/A) Actual application was 23.66 lbs/A making the application rate 12.24 lbs/A.

A pure live seed calculation was done to calculate amount of seed per acre needed to achieve the 12 lbs/A of pure live seed.

 The calculation equaled 23 lbs/A seeding rate to achieve the 12 lbs/A of pure seed (see papers attached).

 Clover was seeded with John Deere 5220 tractor traveling at 5.0 mph, gear B3 at 2000 rpm’s, and Gandy Air Seeder (15 ft boom length) equipped with 8 deflectors spaced 22.5 inches. 

Gandy motor setting was 2 with the red metering wheels in and the gates on the Gandy were in the first position. 

Boom height was 23 inches from the ground, bottom of the defectors were 20 inches from the ground. 

Start of 1st application was 7:00 a.m. on 03/04/2022 weather was clear 18 degrees F 0 mph wind.

End of application 10:30 a.m. sunny 29 degrees F 0 mph wind. 

Start of 2nd application was 7:10 a.m. on 03/05/2022 weather was clear 34 degrees F 0 mph wind.

End of application 8:15 a.m. sunny 35 degrees F 0 mph wind.

Soybeans were planted in the T3 plots on May 22, 2021.

Seed corn maggot was eating the soybean seed so we had a poor stand of beans.


On first observation and a few quick stand counts we have 20-50K seeds per acre. At a minimum we need 50K seeds per acre to expect any chance of a respectable yield for the T3 plots.

We had many things go wrong in the T3 plots: soybeans were planted after a rye cover crop into dry soil, soybeans were in the ground when we had 4 nights of cold temperatures, and we have not received much rain this year.

However, the biggest concern is the seed corn maggot.

It seems we have had a perfect storm for the T3 soybeans.

1.      We have evidence of seed corn maggot feeding on the soybean seeds and stems which has been backed up by our seed dealer. Our seed dealer has other customers that had problems this spring with seed corn maggot feeding on soybeans. In all cases with the seed corn maggot feeding on the soybeans has been following a rye cover crop (which is what we have in the T3 plots).

Brook, Leon, and I looked at the soybeans in the T3 plots and I asked Mike Staton to join me. Mike is the MSU Extension Soybean Educator, Mike is responsible for the Michigan Soybean On-Farm Research. Mike was at KBS today completing data collection with some of the trails that he is working with Brook on. I asked Mike to look at the T3 plots and Mike agrees that we have evidence of seed corn maggot feeding.

Gary our crop scout will not have time to look the plots until Friday.    

Basically, we have three options:

1.       1. We can keep the plots as is. We do have a treatment effect from the rye cover crop.

2.      2. We can replant the field. Start all over by spraying the current stand of soybeans and replanting the soybeans.

3.   We can inter-seed more soybeans in between the existing rows of soybeans.

Soybeans were planted in the T3 plots on May 22, 2021.

Seed corn maggot was eating the soybean seed so we had a poor stand of beans.


On first observation and a few quick stand counts we have 20-50K seeds per acre. At a minimum we need 50K seeds per acre to expect any chance of a respectable yield for the T3 plots.

We had many things go wrong in the T3 plots: soybeans were planted after a rye cover crop into dry soil, soybeans were in the ground when we had 4 nights of cold temperatures, and we have not received much rain this year.

However, the biggest concern is the seed corn maggot.

It seems we have had a perfect storm for the T3 soybeans.

1.      We have evidence of seed corn maggot feeding on the soybean seeds and stems which has been backed up by our seed dealer. Our seed dealer has other customers that had problems this spring with seed corn maggot feeding on soybeans. In all cases with the seed corn maggot feeding on the soybeans has been following a rye cover crop (which is what we have in the T3 plots).

Brook, Leon, and I looked at the soybeans in the T3 plots and I asked Mike Staton to join me. Mike is the MSU Extension Soybean Educator, Mike is responsible for the Michigan Soybean On-Farm Research. Mike was at KBS today completing data collection with some of the trails that he is working with Brook on. I asked Mike to look at the T3 plots and Mike agrees that we have evidence of seed corn maggot feeding.

Gary our crop scout will not have time to look the plots until Friday.    

Basically, we have three options:

1.       1. We can keep the plots as is. We do have a treatment effect from the rye cover crop.

2.      2. We can replant the field. Start all over by spraying the current stand of soybeans and replanting the soybeans.

3.   We can inter-seed more soybeans in between the existing rows of soybeans.

2010-11-03,,,LTER_Alleyway,Turfgrass seed (variety listed in description),250,pound,,E,,"Planted grass in LTER main site alleyways. Alleyways which were seeded were on the north end of replicate 5, south of all plots along B Avenue, and area immediately to west of Cellulosic Ethanol Study. Seeded areas were seeded with the Brillion SS12 seeder in 2-3 complete passes over all areas. Soil had been previously worked up with chisle plow, subsoiler, disc harrow, and soil finisher, however, in the ensuing 3-4 weeks we had received a couple of rains so the soil was somewhat packed down. It was determined that 2-3 passes of the Brillion's packers loosened the soil sufficient to allow the seed to obtain good contact with the soil and for a significant amount of seed to be buried. 825 pounds of seed were used to cover an area of approximately 3.3 acres. This worked out to be approximately 250 lbs/A. An additional 50 pounds approximately was hand seeded at intersections with other drives and at the start and end of the alleys that were seeded. The mixture of seed used was Kalamazoo Wear Green Mix from Kalamazoo Landscape Supply. Kalamazoo Wear Green Mix was composed of 33.25% 2nd Millennium Tall Fescue, 33.22% Lexington Tall Fescue, 33.16% of Kalahari Tall Fescue, and 0.33% inert matter; the seed mix had a stated germination rate of 85%.

TREES PLANTED: NM-6 (Populus nigra x populus maximowiczii), Length of cuttings: 10 inches. Cost was $0.19 each. We contracted the tree planting to Midwest Forestry, Inc., Scottville, MI (231) 757-4925. Midwest used five people to plant the trees. Two members of the LTER staff helped plant reps 5, 2, 3, and 4.

PLOT LAYOUT: Row spacing: 8 feet between tree columns (spaced east to west) and 5 feet between trees (spaced north to south) within a column. Trees per acre = 1,089.

FIELD PREPARATION: The LTER staff preformed the plot layout over a 2-3 week period before Midwest planted the trees. Tape marks were placed onto a 125' metal chain every 5 feet to indicate the within column spacing. The 125' metal chain was selected because it the longest chain that could be easily moved by two people and was heavy enough to press down shrubs and brush that were within the columns. Location of tree columns were marked with garden stakes on the north and south end of the plots and well as two sets of stakes approximately 1/3 and 2/3 from the end of each plot. Columns were staggered with alternating ones starting at the field edge and the remaining ones starting 2 1/2 feet in from the field edge. A total of 36 columns were marked north to south across the field. Tree row locations were marked every 5' in the field by spraying a 2”-3” diameter dot of water-based marking paint at each tape location on the chain; each column had 67 or 68 trees (east to west) depending on its starting location and field size. 
PLANTING: Trees were planted into 3 cm wide x 20-25 cm long tapered holes made by forcing a custom-made tree-planting stick into the ground, wiggling it around slightly, and removing it. Cuttings were planted such that 1 or 2 dormant buds were left exposed above ground. Cuttings were then snugged into the holes by stepping on and compacting the soil around the edge of the hole.
